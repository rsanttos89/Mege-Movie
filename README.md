# Next.js Movie App

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
cd your-repository
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

After cloning the repository, install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
# or
bun install
```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

To use the application, you need to consume the API provided by [The Movie Database (TMDb)](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api). Follow these steps to set up your API key:

1. **Create a TMDb Account**:  
   Visit [TMDb's website](https://www.themoviedb.org/signup) and sign up for a free account.

2. **Obtain an API Key**:  
   After creating an account, navigate to your account settings, find the "API" section, and request a new API key.

3. **Configure the Environment Variable**:  
   Create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project.  
   Add your API key to this file as follows:

   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_KEY=your_tmdb_api_key_here
   ```

   Replace `your_tmdb_api_key_here` with the API key you obtained from TMDb.

### 4. Run the Development Server

Once you have set up the environment variables, start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

### 5. Image Loading Configuration

If you encounter issues with loading images from external sources (e.g., `image.tmdb.org`), make sure your `next.config.js` includes the following configuration:

```javascript
// next.config.js
module.exports = {
  images: {
    remotePatterns: [
      {
        protocol: 'https',
        hostname: 'image.tmdb.org',
        pathname: '/t/p/**',
      },
    ],
  },
};
```
